Java Development Internship - OASIS INFOBYTE -PROJECT SHOWCASE
Welcome to Oasis Infobyte Java Development Projects repository. This repository contains two Java projects: "Online Examination Systems and ATM Interface ."Both project is described in briefly below:

Project:ATM Interface
This project was required me to develop a console-based application that emulated the functionalities of an ATM machine. I had to implement features such as displaying a menu of options, prompting the user for input, and updating account balances based on the user's actions. This project helped me develop my skills in Java programming, especially in working with classes, objects, and methods.

Project : Online Examination System
This project allowed me to learn how to create a user-friendly interface for an online exam. I was able to implement features such as user authentication, a timer for the exam, and automatic submission of answers.
